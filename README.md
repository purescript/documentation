Welcome to the PureScript documentation repository!

PureScript is a small, strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
To get a better overview of PureScript, visit [The PureScript Website](http://purescript.org).

This repository is meant to be a collaborative effort, so please feel free to make a pull request to add/edit content or create an issue to discuss it. Without you, PureScript would have *no* documentation! Thanks for helping!

## Project Scope

Topics currently in this repository's scope:

- PureScript language reference documentation
- Its compiler errors
- Core concepts on which the language is based
- Introduction to package managers and dependency management
- Comparison with similar languages
- An introduction to other sources of documentation

Topics currently *not* in scope:

- Using PureScript libraries (those docs belong with the corresponding libraries)
- A PureScript language teaching course (use the [PureScript by Example](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) book or other resources)

Feel free to make an issue to discuss amending the scope.

## Language Guides

The [PureScript Book](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read) is the recommended approach to learning the language, since it covers more material in greater depth. There is also a language guide, which is more useful as a reference:

- [Language Reference](language/README.md)
