## Global changes

The following changes are not listed below because they appear multiple times:
- Migrate FFI to ES modules
- Update project and dependencies to v0.15.0 PureScript
- Added `purs-tidy` formatter
- Dropped deprecated `MonadZero` instances
- Dropped deprecated `math` dependency; updated imports
- Miscellaneous CI fixes that aren't relevant to end-users

If a library's changes consisted only of the above entries, it was removed from this list.

## `purescript` Libraries

### purescript-arrays

Breaking changes:
- Drop deprecated `group'` and `empty` (#219 by @JordanMartinez)

Other improvements:
- Fixed minor documentation issue with `find` (#216 by @JamieBallingall)

### purescript-console

New features:
- Added `debug` (#36)

### purescript-control

Breaking changes:
- Make `<|>` right associative (#80 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-foldable-traversable

Breaking changes:
- Drop deprecated `foldMap1Default` (#147 by @JordanMartinez)

Other improvements:

### purescript-foreign

Other improvements:
- Replace all usages of `F` and `FT` with `Except`/`ExceptT (NonEmptyList ForeignError)` (#87 by @JordanMartinez)

  Often times, the `F` and `FT` aliases did more to hinder usage of this library than help. These aliases
  haven't been deprecated, but usage of them is now discouraged. All code in the library now uses
  the full type that is aliased by `F` and `FT`.

Breaking changes:
- Drop deprecated `unfoldCofree`; use `buildCofree` instead (#124 by @JordanMartinez)

- The internal FFI function `join` in `Data.Show` has been renamed to `intercalate` to
  match the same function in `Data.Show.Generic` (#274 by @cdepillabout)

### purescript-quickcheck

Breaking changes:
- Replaced polymorphic proxies with monomorphic `Proxy` (#132 by @JordanMartinez)
- Make `frequency` use `NonEmptyArray` (#131 by @JordanMartinez)

  Now `oneOf` and `frequency` both use `NonEmptyArray` rather than `NonEmptyList`.

### purescript-aff

Breaking changes:

Other improvements:
- Ensure all directly-imported packages are included in the `spago.dhall` file (#205 by @ptrfrncsmrph)

### purescript-argonaut-core

Other improvements:
* Fixed readme bug where `jsonParser` was imported from `Data.Argonaut.Core` instead of `Data.Argonaut.Parser` (#50 by @flip111)

### purescript-argonaut-traversals

Other improvements:
- Updated `README.md` to make the Quick start example runnable (#37 by @dk949)

### purescript-arraybuffer

Breaking Changes:
- Replaced polymorphic proxies with monomorphic `Proxy` (#41 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-css

Breaking changes:
- Add support for `calc` expressions (#140 by @nsaunders)
- Add table selector (#141 by @plurip-software)
- Update the box-shadow implementation (#88 by @vyorkin)
- Dropped almost all named colors (#156 by @JordanMartinez)

  These colors were originally defined in `purescript-colors` (i.e.
  one module per schema) because each schema should be defined as its
  own library. This change was propagated to this release.

New features:
- Add smart constructors for generic font families (#68, #136 by @Unisay and @JordanMartinez)
- Add support for `text-direction` (#83, #137 by @vyorkin and @JordanMartinez)
- Add outline and constituent properties (#145 by @nsaunders)
- Add support for `visibility` property (#148 by @nsaunders)

Other improvements:
- Remove ending space in css output (e.g. `padding: 1 2 3 4 `) (#135 by @chexxor and @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-fork

Other improvements:
- Ensure all imported packages are in the spago.dhall file (#17 by @artemisSystem)

### purescript-now

Other improvements:
- Added tests (#20 by @ntwilson)
- Added quick start (#22 by @maxdeviant)

### purescript-parsing

Breaking changes:
- New optimized internals. `ParserT` now has a more efficient representation,
  resulting in (up to) 20x performance improvement. In addition to the performance,
  all parser execution is always stack-safe, even monadically, obviating the need
  to run parsers with `Trampoline` as the base Monad or to explicitly use `MonadRec`.

  Code that was parametric over the underlying Monad no longer needs to propagate a
  Monad constraint.

  Code that constructs parsers via the underlying representation will need to be updated,
  but otherwise the interface is unchanged and parsers should just enjoy the speed boost.

  (#154 by @natefaubion)
- Make `<??>` right-associative (#164 by @JordanMartinez)
- Drop `<?>` and `<~?>` prec from 3 to 4 (#163, #164 by @JordanMartinez)

  `<|>` was made right associative. Decreasing these two operators
  prevents a compiler error (i.e. `MixedAssociativityError`)
  without causing issues with `<$>`.

### purescript-profunctor-lenses

- Replaced polymorphic proxies with monomorphic `Proxy` (#141 by @JordanMartinez)

New features:

Bugfixes:
- Fix broken `reindex` for v0.15 due to [Purescript PR #4033](https://github.com/purescript/purescript/pull/4033)

Other improvements:
- Replace manual tests with automated tests using `assert` (#135 by @neppord)
- Improve documentation for `united` (#134 by @neppord)
- Add guide on impredicativity explaining difference between `Lens` vs `ALens` (#136 by @i-am-tom and @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-quickcheck-laws

Breaking changes:
- Drop `Proxy2`/`Proxy3` usage in favor of just `Proxy` (#59 by @JordanMartinez)

New features:
- Provide `Arbitrary`-less law checks (#36 by @matthewleon, #57 by @JordanMartinez)

Other improvements:

Breaking changes:
- Replaced polymorphic proxies with monomorphic `Proxy` (#41 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-uri

Bugfixes:
- Made all parsers stack safe on long input (#63 by @garyb)
- Exceptions are no longer thrown when using e.g. `valueFromString` with lone surrogates (#68 by @ysangkok)

Other improvements:
- Update README.md rfc link (#67 @codingedgar)

## `purescript-web` Libraries

### purescript-canvas

Breaking changes:
- Support arcs that are drawn counter-clockwise (#58, #83 by @karljs and @JordanMartinez)
- The `Transform` type now uses the field names `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e` and `f`, instead of `m11`, `m12`, `m21`, `m22`, `m31` and `m32` (#86 by @artemisSystem)

New features:
- Added `createImageDataWith` (#81)

Other improvements:
- Added ESLint config and fixed the resulting linter issues (#82)

### purescript-web-cssom

Breaking changes:
- Update `CSSStyleDeclaration` functions to take `style` arg last (#12 by @theqp)

  This follows the convention of "the thing being operated on" occurs
  last in function that take multiple arguments.

### purescript-web-dom

Breaking changes:
- Unwrap returned `Effect` for `doctype` (#52 by @JordanMartinez)
- Port `getBoundingClientRect` from `web-html`; set arg to `Element` (#53 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-web-events

New features:
- Add FFI for `CustomEvent` constructor (#25 by @JordanMartinez)
- Add `addEventListenerWithOptions` to expose more options (#25 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-web-file

Other improvements:
- Update `Math` import to use `Data.Number` (#20 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-web-html

Breaking changes:
- Move `getBoundingClientRect` to `purescript-web-dom` (#73 by @JordanMartinez)
- Drop duplicated `set/getClassName` and `classList` (#74 by @JordanMartinez)

  These three entities are already defined in `purescript-web-dom`

### purescript-node-fs-aff

Breaking changes:
- Update `mkdir'` to take options arg (#34 by @JordanMartinez)

### purescript-node-fs

Breaking changes:
- Update `mkdir` to take an options record arg, exposing `recursive` option (#53, #55, #58 by @JordanMartinez)

  To get back the old behavior of `mkdir'`, you would call `mkdir' { recursive: false, mode: mkPerms all all all }`

### purescript-node-streams

Other improvements:
- Fix `Gzip` example (#17, #36 by @matthewleon and @JordanMartinez)
