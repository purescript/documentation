## PureScript Unscripted

We video conference once a month to learn about projects and concepts within our community! They're currently limited to 50 participants but will also be uploaded to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPtHLGu_WXh-OvX8NAVtDEw). Bring your own pizza ;)

Write down questions you'd like answered about topics to give to speakers.

## PureScript Hack Session

We video conference once a month to hack on projects within our community! Bring your own pizza ;)

Anyone is welcome to intro their PureScript project (including written in Haskell or JavaScript) and invite attendees to hack and collaborate with them. Alternatively, use the time to sit with other PureScripters while working on your personal project, one-player-style. We can break out into mini-video conferences and reconvene after a bit to demo and debrief, if desired.

What do you wanna hack? Wanna pitch your project?

## PureScript Co-Learning Sessions

Sit together in a virtual room and help each other learn PureScript. Intended to be a helpful, friendly place for beginners.

Unraveling an error message or a algebraic concept can be incredibly frustrating while learning PureScript, but breaking through such quandaries is greatly eased by working through it with peers. This meetup is intended to provide such an environment to PureScript developers.

### Schedule

Sundays, 1pm Pacific Time - [WorldTimeBuddy TimeConverter](http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=5391959,2643743,658225,2147714&h=5391959&date=2016-4-23&sln=13-15)
